## User Story
As a user I want to see random generated quotes on the screen, so that I can guess which personality the quote belongs to.
Given the quote, When I select my answer, then my score and timer change.



## Description 
The user will have to guess which of the three personalities(Donald Trump, Kanye West, and Ron Swanson) said the quote displayed on the screen. The user will have 60 seconds to select an answer.
If their answer is correct, the amount of time left in the timer will be added to their score. If the answer is incorrect, ten seconds are deducted from the timer. The game ends when the timer runs out.
At the end, the user will have the option to submit their name and highs core.

## Usage
Open the application [Who Said It?](https://justinwestmoreland.github.io/Project-1/) in your browser. Read the instructions, then click the "Play!" button to start the game. Each picture works as a button. Select your answer for the displayed quote. Once the timer runs out, you will see the High Score screen in which you will be able to save your results.
